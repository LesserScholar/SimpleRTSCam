Simple RTS Cam mod for Bannerlord

RTS camera mod written from scratch. This mod doesn't have the advanced features of RTS Camera but instead provides only the core camera functionality.

In combat, press F10 to unlock the camera from your character. Press F10 again to go back to controlling your character.
Use mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out
Press mouse right to change the camera angle
Use movement keys to fly around

While you are in the tactical view, your character will be idle. If your mount had momentum before switching modes, they will keep running forwards.
